pebble-qrwatch
==============

QR Code watch for pebble.  Inspired by QRclock for raspberry pi.

Is this totally useless?  Yes, probably.  But, it was a fun little project
to get into development for the Pebble.

QR library is from https://github.com/ksasq/QR-Image-embedded

The QR code contains the time and date (separated by a line break) and is
displayed centered on the Pebble's display.
